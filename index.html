                <p class="text-justify">In the same college course I learned how to use India inks and how to treat the paper to prevent the edges from curling. I also took print making classes, I i also know how to use a printing press, and various methods of print making. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">After taking some many art classes I had a desire to expand upon the mediums I was familiar with. I have had experience with markers before, but I wanted to know how to blend them, and make them flow. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">Pencils, when compared to the fluidity of characoal, are rather rigid and stiff. So making them blend, and not smudge was difficult for me, but when I got comfortable with I began to love pencil drawings.</p>

                <h3>Pottery</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">I took my first ceramics class in high school, and I was instantly enamored with this medium. I loved everything from the smell of the clay, to the natural messy demeanor of the the process, and the endless posssiblities of creation it offered me. I pursued pottery even into college, taking several courses that included ceramics in its criteria. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">I have always found scultpures to be interesting, but when I actually started to create my own I grew a new admiration for scultpors. The thought process, patiences, planning, and skill needed to get the former onto your medium that you only have one go at amazed me. I worked with plaster, wood, clay, glass, wax, and bronze. </p>

                <h3>Basket Weaving</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">Basket weaving is a relatively new medium for me. Before I only knew how to weave simple wreathes, and link them together into a chain. Basket weaving in constrast is much more difficult. The hardest part is keeping track and maintaining the basic structure of the piece. It has so many diffent branhes that move so easily that one wrong move can knock the support frame out of place, or cause the side to unwind and loosen.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">I have done only a fewthings with metal, some on my own, and some in classes. I have done black smithing, jewlery making, soddering, and bronze casting, all of which I enjoyed greatly. The out comes of all the projects were even more rewarding knowing how much I labored, sweat, and struggled to create each one.</p>

                <h3>Photography</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">I have always loved photography, so in high school I took a class on it. I found that I enjoyed both traditional and digital photography. Being in the dark room with it's cool quiet acidic smell became rather relaxing for me. Painting on hand developed pictures became my favorite, and the one I dedicated themost time to during that time.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">I got my first experience with photoshop and Light Room in high school. There was so much I could do with it, and I established the basic skills for editing, and experimenting with the programs was fantastic.</p>

                <h3>Digital Art</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">Drawing with a computer offers color options, textures, and more brushes than any art store could ever dream of, not to mention it's a lot easier to carry around on a daily basis. It offers painting, sketching, ink, or line art abilites to an artist. I wish to pursue digital art more, I have so few options available to me at the moment for this.  </p>
